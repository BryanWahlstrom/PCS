What is a test spy? Is it closer to a mock or a stub? Or neither?
it lets you see results from other functions outside your test.
lets you see how things would happen for the user




How do you use a spy to facilitate the concept of mocking?
I"m not sure




Why would we watch objects to find out if certain functions have been called?
I'm confused about all this spying stuff




What are the use cases for mocks in Javascript? Are they different from Ruby?
Chuck needs to get back and do an extended lecture on this!
