In your own words, summarize the 7 things on page 9-11 that jQuery does well
1. Access elements in a document: it's easy to select stuff using their CSS elements
2. Modify the appearance of a web page: after the page has loaded and rendered you can still make changes to the appearance of the page "after the fact", change things separate from the CSS sheet
3. Alter the content of a document: you can modify content, not just appearance
4. Respond to a user's interaction: allows you to time if and when the magic happens according to what the user is doing
5. Animate changes being made to a document: visual effects to show user the changes happening
6. Retrieve information from a server without refreshing a page: the magic of Ajax
7. Simplify common JavaScript tasks: enhances basic JavaScript stuff
